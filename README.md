# inc-projekt
This is the VHDL project for the INC (Digital systems design) course at FIT BUT. I knew nothing about what I was doing and I was quite desperate, as you can see here.
- The course took place in the summer semester of 2022/2023

při tvorbě tohoto projektu jsem byl dost zoufalej vizte commit history 🤣

ale nakonec to funguje takže pohodička navíc vymyslel jsem to sám 😎
